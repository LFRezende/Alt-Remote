    Sum Game - GIT TRAINING

    This game is meant to train git branching, rebasing, reflogging...
    So to be cracked at it.

    For it to work, we'll start with a base main branch.
    Each branch will create a series of commits which create 
    math operations, which envision to nullify another branch. 

    Each branch must have at least three commits, each named
    in the conventional, accepted way.

a = 3

# Sum of the practicing game:

S = a + b + c

# After setting new upstream.
S += int(b*c/a)
